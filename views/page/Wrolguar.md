Wrolguars are seemingly pack creatures.  They tend to live near tropical coastlines in caverns, though they have very good swimming capabilities and pack tactics.  Finding one on their own is not only rare, as they try to stay hidden, but not very dangerous.  Finding a pack of them is often a deadly situation.
## __Details__
Wrolguars are scaled with greenish hues, have webbed claws and multiple layers of sharp teeth, much like a shark.  In fact, their snouts are much closer to that of an oceanic shark’s, while their build is more of an agile dog.  However, given their webbed feet and scales, they are very good swimmers, and have a decent natural armor.  A bite from one of these creatures is enough to tear and grossly sever limbs, where the claws are meant more for sprinting - to rapidly get close and finish their prey.
