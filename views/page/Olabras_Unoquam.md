Not much is known about Olabras.
## __An old man in a robe...__
This entity is rarely mentioned in the deepest corners of the largest libraries, mostly in arcane tomes dedicated to recording the achievements of long-passed mages.  He is often described as an older man with thick, dark hair and a bushy black beard, who looks much older than he really was.  For a human, he’s described to have an oddly gaunt face, deep-set eyes, and more wrinkles than one would expect.  In later tomes, he’s often noted for looking much lither and disturbingly thin.
## __...claiming communion with the divine.__
He is known for explaining much of the mysteries of death - where souls go after they pass from the Material Plane, what causes them to go where they do, and who has control over them.  Some even talk about entities beyond these realms.  However, it is never revealed as to where or how he got this information, and some of these ancient tomes are even missing pages.
## __...Madness.__
After a while, he seems to fade away from historical and arcane text itself.  No research notes of his were ever found, nor are there any records of his death.  Not even his family, who had long passed before he disappeared, knew what kind of experiments this mage was conducting.
## __Lost to Time__
Now, he’s passed into myth.  Not many know of him and those who do either stay silent or seem to stay hidden.
